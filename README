WHAT IS THIS?
=============
In gnome-shell it's easy to miss a notification for a new chat message if you
are not looking constantly at your screen. Message notifier is an extension
that solves this problem by showing how many chats with unread messages you
have.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============
The best way to get this extension is by visiting its page on
extensions.gnome.org: http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/150

If you need to modify the source then the git repository is the best
solution: http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/bari/shell-message-notifier.git/
Type "make force-install" to install the extension, then follow the
instructions printed on screen.

DEBUGGING
=========
If you have some problems with the extension you can help me debugging it
by providing some logs.
In a terminal type (as normal user):
  MESSAGE_NOTIFIER_DEBUG=1 gnome-shell --replace > gnome-shell.log 2>&1
Now try to reproduce the bug, when you are done open another terminal window
and type:
  gnome-shell --replace &
This command will restart the shell as normal. Now send me "gnome-shell.log"
after checking it doesn't contain any personal information, like the content
of some private chat messages.
