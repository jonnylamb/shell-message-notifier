WHAT IS THIS?
=============
In gnome-shell it's easy to miss a notification for a new chat message if you
are not looking constantly at your screen. Message notifier is an extension
that solves this problem by showing how many chats with unread messages you
have.
See programs.txt for instructions on which programs are supported and how to
get them to work.

The extension is licenced under GPL 2 or later because it contains files
copied from gnome-shell-extensions. The code I wrote myself is under LGPL 2 or
later, so you can more easily include it in your project if you need it.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============
The best way to get this extension is by visiting its page on
extensions.gnome.org: http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/150

If you need to modify the source, then the git repository is the best
solution: http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/bari/shell-message-notifier.git/
Type "make force-install" to install the extension, then follow the
instructions printed on screen.
