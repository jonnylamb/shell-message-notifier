Here is a list of applications supported by this extension. Some of them need
some changes to the preferences to enable notification bubbles.


Empathy/gnome-shell chat
========================
It works out of the box!


Pidgin
======
Click on the “Tools” menu and then “Plug-ins”. Make sure that the “Libnotify
Popups” plugin is enabled. If the plugin is not in the list, it means you need
to install it. On Debian the package is called “pidgin-libnotify”, other
distros should have a package with a similar name.


XChat-GNOME
===========
Click on the “Edit” menu and then “Preferences”. In the “Scripts and Plugins”
tab make sure that “On-screen display” is enabled.


XChat
=====
Click on the “Settings” menu and then “Preferences”. In the “Alerts” tab make
sure that “Show tray baloons” is enabled for both “Private Message” and
“Highlighted Message”.
If the notifications pile up in the bottom right corner of your screen and
clicking on them does nothing, it means that XChat is using notify-send
because it cannot find libnotify. I don’t know how to fix this issue on your
particular distro, but <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=693362>
describes the problem for Fedora.


Need support for other programs?
================================
If you need support for any other common application, just ask! (My email is
marco@barisione.org.)
The only prerequisite is that the program needs to use standard notification
bubbles (and this means I cannot add support for Skype).

Note that the extension doesn't support email clients by design. Most people
get a lot of emails and it would be annoying to get notified for every new
email.
