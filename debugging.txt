If you have any problem with the extension, you can help me debugging it by
providing some logs.
In a terminal type (as normal user):
  MESSAGE_NOTIFIER_DEBUG=1 gnome-shell --replace > gnome-shell.log 2>&1

When shell restarted press ALT+F2, type "r" and press "Return" (this should
not be needed, but it seems to be necessary in the version I have installed).

Now try to reproduce the bug, when you are done open another terminal window
and restart the shell with:
  gnome-shell --replace &

Now send "gnome-shell.log" to marco@barisione.org after checking it doesn't
contain any personal information, like the content of some private chat
messages.
