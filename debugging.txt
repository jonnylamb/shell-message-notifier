If you have any problem with the extension, you can help me debugging it by
providing some logs.
In a terminal type (as normal user):
  MESSAGE_NOTIFIER_DEBUG=1 gnome-shell --replace > gnome-shell.log 2>&1

When shell restarted press ALT+F2, type "r" and press "Return" (this should
not be needed, but it seems to be necessary in the version I have installed).

Now try to reproduce the bug, when you are done open another terminal window
and type:
  gnome-shell --replace &

This command will restart the shell as normal. Now send me "gnome-shell.log"
after checking it doesn't contain any personal information, like the content
of some private chat messages.
